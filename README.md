# TwoDVideoGameTemplate

_**This was developed in a short time period in May 2020- as an entertaining side project- and development was not active since then. The most recent commits, however, were only for brief cleanup.**_

**Please note this is a work in progress. It is technically in its very first release, and so therefore it is certainly not as refined as the developer would want. However, it can be built upon as is by users.**

JavaScript code for a 2D video game template using the P5 JavaScript Graphics Library. This code is designed to run on a server (if using VSCode, right click on the index.html file within the TwoDVideoGameTemplate folder, and select "Open With Live Server"). This application is not a completed game, but is rather a crude code template upon which can be used to build a web game. A rather simple example of the player collecting pumpkins in a field is included, but can be removed by the users who wish to build new functionality onto the template.
