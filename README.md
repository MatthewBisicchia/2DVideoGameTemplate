# TwoDVideoGameTemplate
JavaScript code for a 2D video game template using the P5 JavaScript Graphics Library. This code is designed to run on a server (if using VSCode, right click on the index.html file within the TwoDVideoGameTemplate folder, and select "Open With Live Server"). This application is not a completed game, but is rather a crude code template upon which can be used to build a web game. A rather simple example of the player collecting pumpkins in a field is included, but can be removed by the users who wish to build new functionality onto the template. 

**Please note this is a work in progress on the developer's end. It is technically in its very first release, and so therefore it is certainly not as refined as the developer would want. Was quickly developed as an entertaining side study. However, it can be built upon as is by users.**

**This was developed in a short time period in May 2020, and development was not active since then. The most recent commit, however, was only a brief cleanup.**
